General:
  + printf is a C function
  - struct vs class: by default struct members are public, whereas class members are private
  - memset(): https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memset/
  - Uint32 vs uint32 vs uint32_t
  - try to imagine new Uint32 *buffer = new Uint32[SCREEN_WIDTH * SCREEN_HEIGHT]. Also try to imagine buffer[30000] = 0xFFFFFFFF;
  - in for loop, what is the difference btw i++ and ++i
  - practice using namespaces (e.g. namespace simulation {class Screen() {}})
